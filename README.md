# Village-of-Testing
This project showcases XUnit testing and also delegates

A C# "village simulator" console program that uses a delegate to gather the resources of a villager's specific profession.
In this program you can:
- Add workers and assign them to a profession
- Gather resources for your village
- Add buildings to a project list, have your villagers build it with the resources gathered and get it moved to a buildings list.
- The completed buildings will grant buffs for your village; A house increases the population limit, a woodmill increases the amount of wood gathered etc.

You start off on day 1 and everyday you have to feed your workers. The ultimate goal is to build a castle.
